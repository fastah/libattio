# Fastah's unofficial Go SDK for the Attio CRM

This is a Go SDK for the Attio CRM API, generated using OpenAPI specifications.

# Update/Rebuild the SDK 
Make sure the [latest Attio spec ](https://docs.attio.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/openapi)is downloaded to this `specs` directory.

## Prerequisites
To rebuild the Go SDK, make sure the [OpenAPI-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation) tool is installed

```

OR

```bash
make codegen 
```
